## SeCVOS Benchmark

We propose the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation (SeCVOS) benchmark, specifically designed to assess a modelâ€™s ability to perform high-level semantic reasoning across complex visual narratives. SeCVOS contains 160 carefully curated multi-shot videos characterized by: 1) Highly discontinuous frame sequences, 2) Frequent reappearance of objects across disparate scenes, and 3) Abrupt shot transitions and dynamic camera motion.

| DAVIS | 90 | 2.87 | 16.1% | 1.06 |
| YTVOS | 507 | 4.51 | 13.0% | 1.03 |
| MOSE | 311 | 8.68* | 41.5% | 1.06 |
| SA-V | 155 | 17.24 | 25.5% | 1.09 |
| LVOS | 140 | 78.36 | 7.8% | 1.47 |
